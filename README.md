# algorhythm

Author: Lam Nguyen
Date started: November 3. 2016

I am Lam Nguyen, a member of the programming team Algorhythm from Dickinson College 2016. 
I created this repository to keep track of Java implementations to most common algorithms in competitive programming. 
This is in preparation for the ACM Regional, which takes place in 2 days (talking of last minute preparation), and the Dickinson Programming Contest in the spring of 2017.
I also hope that this repository will be useful for the underground Dickinson Programming Club that I co-founded with Professor Skalak.

Currently, due to the last-minute nature of this work, I took most of the code from http://www.sanfoundry.com/. In the long run, I will create my own implementations, and add extensive comments. I invite all developers to contribute to this repository. Some areas that need work now are:
- Commenting the existing code
- Add more algorithm implementations
- Add test cases to each algorithm

I will also update this README file as we go.
